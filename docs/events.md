# Events

How events reach Twake Space, what the backend does with them, and how the result reaches the browser.

## Terms

- Platform event: a RabbitMQ message from ldap-rest or another platform service (exchanges `space`, `b2b`, `admin-panel`, `settings`). It has a routing key, a message id, and a JSON body.
- Activity event: a CloudEvent (specversion `1.0`) an app publishes on the `activity` exchange, with the CloudEvent `type` as routing key.
- Copy: the backend's Postgres copy of organizations, spaces, members, linked groups and resources.
- Card: a space feed item showing the activity events about one object, stored in `feed_cards` and pointing at the object's latest event in `activity_events`.
- Post: a space feed item a member writes, stored in `feed_posts`.
- Live event: a message the backend pushes to a browser over SSE: `spaces`, `notification` or `feed`.

## Consuming RabbitMQ

The backend consumes one queue, `twake-space`, through [@linagora/rabbitmq-client](https://github.com/linagora/rabbitmq-client/tree/v0.7.1). At startup it declares the queue and binds it to each platform event it handles, routing key equal to the event name:

- `space`: `twake.space.created`, `twake.space.updated`, `twake.space.deleted`, `twake.space.member.added`, `twake.space.member.role.changed`, `twake.space.member.removed`, `twake.space.group.linked`, `twake.space.group.role.changed`, `twake.space.group.unlinked`
- `b2b`: `b2b.group.updated`, `b2b.member.role.changed`, `b2b.member.disabled`, `domain.user.deleted`, `domain.organization.deleted`, `chat.deprovision`, `chat.deployment.completed`
- `admin-panel`: `dns.validated`
- `settings`: `user.settings.updated`
- `activity`: `#`

The queue:

- Is a quorum queue with a single active consumer and a delivery limit of 20. Each replica consumes with prefetch 1, so messages are handled one at a time, in the order they were published.
- Dead-letters to the `twake-space.dlx` exchange, which routes to the `twake-space.dlq` queue. The backend declares both. The dead letter routing key is the first platform event's, with `.dead` appended (`twake.space.created.dead`).
- Has the client's other arguments, `x-overflow: reject-publish` and `x-dead-letter-strategy: at-least-once`.
- Gets each message acknowledged only after its Postgres transaction commits.

Startup fails when `space`, `b2b` or `admin-panel` is missing, since other services own them. The backend declares `activity` and `settings` itself, as durable topic exchanges: the apps declare `activity` the same way, and declaring `settings` lets the backend run on a platform without common settings.

Every name above is a setting, listed in [Deploying](deploy.md#rabbitmq-names). The router and the handlers always see the default routing keys and the default `activity` name: the consumer translates them back before routing. A renamed platform exchange is kept as is, so `parked_events` rows and log lines show the deployment's name.

Local `docker-compose.yml` runs RabbitMQ and declares the three exchanges the backend only checks.

## Routing

The router picks a handler by exchange:

- `activity`: the key is the CloudEvent `type`. The dedupe key is `{ source, id }` of the CloudEvent.
- Any other exchange: the key is the routing key. The dedupe key is `{ source: 'amqp', id: messageId }`.

Each message ends in one outcome:

- processed: the handler ran.
- duplicate: `processed_events` already holds `(consumer, source, id)`, so the handler did not run.
- unrouted: no handler for the key. Logged at debug and acknowledged.
- malformed: a CloudEvent that does not parse, a platform event without a message id (nor a `request_id` in its body, which stands in for it), or a handler threw `MalformedEventError`. Logged and acknowledged. A body that is not JSON goes to the dead letter queue.
- rejected: a handler threw `RejectedEventError`, or Postgres refused the event's data (an error of class 22, 23 or 54, such as a NUL byte in a preview or a key too long for its index). The message is dead-lettered to `twake-space.dlq`. It carries RabbitMQ's `x-death` header but no reason: the `event rejected` log line has it.
- parked: a handler threw `NotYetKnownError`, because the event is about a space or member the copy does not hold yet. The event goes to the `parked_events` table and is acknowledged. One replica at a time (under an advisory lock) retries parked events, 5 seconds after its previous pass ended. One still waiting after 5 minutes is published through `twake-space.dlx` to `twake-space.dlq`, with its message id and the headers `x-twake-space-exchange`, `x-twake-space-routing-key` and `x-twake-space-reason`; the row stays when that publish fails. A retry that throws keeps the row for the next pass. Any other outcome of a retry, rejected included, deletes the row without a dead letter: only the log line tells.
- failed: any other error, such as Postgres being down. The message stays unacknowledged and is retried in the process, 1 second after the first failure, doubling up to a minute. Nothing behind it is handled meanwhile. After 25 minutes of failures the backend logs an error, because RabbitMQ's `consumer_timeout` (30 minutes by default) then closes the channel and delivers the message again. Each such redelivery, like one after a restart, counts toward the delivery limit: once a message has been delivered 21 times (about 10 hours of failures), RabbitMQ sends it to `twake-space.dlq` and the queue moves on.

The dedupe claim and the handler run in the same Postgres transaction, so a handler failure releases the claim.

To replay a platform event by hand, such as one from `twake-space.dlq`, publish it with its original AMQP `message_id` property. Without one, the backend logs `missing message id` and drops it. A message that was rejected, parked or dead-lettered never kept its claim, so the original id is not seen as a duplicate.

## Ordering

- Events can arrive out of order or be replayed. `last_changes` keeps, per object key, the time of the last change applied.
- A change applies only if its time is at or after the stored one. An event without a time applies to every object.
- `last_changes` rows stay after the object is removed, so a replayed older event cannot bring it back.
- Object keys look like `space:<id>`, `space:<id>:name`, `space:<id>:member:<user>`, `space:<id>:group:<group>`, `space:<id>:resource:<kind>`, `organization:<id>:chat`, `organization:<id>:member:<user>`, `user:<uuid>:deleted`, `email:<email>:deleted`.
- A removal records the member's key even when the copy does not hold them yet, so their older addition stays out.
- A deleted user, matched by uuid or email, is not added back by an older member or role event. A newer one adds them, since an email can be given to a new user.
- A group's newest name is kept in `group_names` even while no space links it, so a link older than a rename takes the new name.

## Platform events

### Meeting organizations

Every platform handler is wrapped: when the body has an `organizationId` the copy does not know yet, the backend reads it once from the directory (ldap-rest) and inserts it with its `domain`, `chatAvailable` and `mailAvailable`. If the directory does not know it, a warning is logged and the handler still runs.

- In a single installation, the organization points to the one configured homeserver.
- In SaaS, the backend asks the chat control plane (`GET deployment/<organizationId>/twake-space`) for the tenant's homeserver and stores it, tokens encrypted. A 404 means chat is not deployed yet. When the control plane fails, the event still runs and the organization keeps no homeserver; on `chat.deployment.completed` the event is parked and retried instead.

### Organization availability

- `chat.deployment.completed`: sets chat available at `deployment.completedAt`, then refreshes the tenant's homeserver. A missing `status` counts as success. Another `status` leaves chat as it is, but the homeserver is still refreshed.
- `chat.deprovision`: sets chat unavailable at `timestamp`.
- `dns.validated`: sets mail available to `mailDnsConfigurationValidated`. It has no time, so the last one handled wins.

### User settings

`user.settings.updated` comes from Twake Workplace common settings. Each message holds all of a person's settings after a change.

- It is stored by the person's lowercased `payload.email`, the only key common settings and TwakeSpace share. A message without an email is dropped.
- A `version` at or below the stored one is dropped. A newer one replaces the stored settings whole. Versions count per common settings account, so a message from another `nickname` behind the same email replaces them whatever its version.
- Only what the UI applies is kept: `language`, `timezone`, `theme` (`light`, `dark` or `auto`), `avatar` and `display_name`. A value of another type is left out.
- Common settings publishes without a message id, so the body's `request_id` stands in for it. A republish of the same version gets a new `request_id`, and the version check drops it.
- `GET /settings` gives the caller theirs, with `null` for anything not set.
- TwakeSpace never calls the common settings API. A person it has had no message about gets the browser's defaults until their settings change, or until an admin republishes everyone with common settings' `POST /api/admin/user/settings/sync`.

The browser reads `GET /settings` once signed in and again each time the tab comes back into focus, since people change their settings in another Twake Workplace app. It applies the answer when it comes. Until then, or when the read fails, the app keeps its own defaults and the theme it last had.

- The language is the one set if TwakeSpace has it, else the browser's.
- The theme is the one set. `auto`, or nothing set, follows the system.
- Dates and the greeting use the timezone set, or the browser's when it is unknown.
- The account menu shows the display name and avatar set, else the name from sign-in and its initials. The greeting uses the same name. Other people keep their directory names.

### Space copy

- `twake.space.created`: inserts the space, its members and its linked groups, and keeps its `actor`, when it is an email, as the space's creator (`created_by`). A replayed creation sets the creator only if none is known, and never changes the space's state, so an archived space or one in the Bin stays there.
- `twake.space.updated`: renames the space. A rename of a space not created yet is parked until the creation arrives, and a rename of a deleted space is dropped.
- `twake.space.deleted`: removes the space, its members, groups and resources, its settings, banner, pins and visits, records their keys in `last_changes`, and drops the space from API tokens.
- `twake.space.member.added`, `twake.space.member.role.changed`: upsert members.
- `twake.space.member.removed`: removes members, with their pins and visits of the space.
- `twake.space.group.linked`, `twake.space.group.role.changed`: upsert linked groups.
- `twake.space.group.unlinked`: removes linked groups.
- `b2b.group.updated`: renames the group in every space.
- `b2b.member.role.changed`: upserts the person's organization role.
- `b2b.member.disabled`: revokes the account's tokens in that organization.
- `domain.user.deleted`: names the person by `uuid` or `internalEmail`. Deletes their notifications, reactions, pins and visits, turns them into `deleted_user` on stored cards and posts, revokes their tokens, removes them from every space and organization, and forgets them as the creator of their spaces, so whoever gets the address next does not manage them. Its time is `timestamp`, or `deletedAt` (ISO 8601 or LDAP generalized time) when it has none, as ldap-rest sends it. An unreadable `deletedAt` leaves it without a time.
- `domain.organization.deleted`: revokes the organization's tokens.

A person sent without a `uuid` (a deletion ldap-rest replays carries none) is matched in the copy by email, among space members and then among the organization roles (in the event's organization when it names one). `b2b.member.disabled` also falls back to the username, among space members only: organization roles hold no username.

Upserts and removals of members, groups and names send a `spaces` live event to the members concerned.

The [space write routes](api.md#space-writes) apply their change to the copy themselves, through the same functions, right after ldap-rest answers. The platform event ldap-rest sends for the same write is then older than the change in `last_changes`, and changes nothing.

## Meeting requests

[`POST /spaces/:spaceId/meetings`](api.md#post-spacesspaceidmeetings) publishes a `com.twake.space.meeting.requested.v1` CloudEvent on the `twake-space` topic exchange, routing key equal to the type. The message is persistent, sent with publisher confirms and `mandatory`, so the route fails when no queue is bound. The calendar side service consumes it, creates the Meet room and the event as the organizer, and its `event.created` activity event brings the card.

```json
{
  "specversion": "1.0",
  "id": "<uuid>",
  "source": "twake://space",
  "type": "com.twake.space.meeting.requested.v1",
  "time": "2026-10-08T10:00:00.000Z",
  "twakeorg": "<organization id>",
  "twakeactorid": "<user uuid>",
  "twakeactor": "alice@example.com",
  "data": {
    "uid": "<uuid>",
    "container": { "kind": "calendar", "id": "<team calendar id>" },
    "title": "Design review",
    "start": "2026-10-08T12:30:00+02:00",
    "end": "2026-10-08T13:00:00+02:00",
    "timezone": "Europe/Paris",
    "description": "Last pass on the mockups"
  }
}
```

`data.uid` is the calendar event's UID. A retry publishes the same UID with a new `id`.

## Activity events

### Resources provisioned by apps

`com.twake.<app>.space.provisioned.v1` records the app's resource for a space (`data.space_id`, `data.resource.kind`, `data.resource.id`):

- `drive` -> `drive`
- `mail` -> `mailbox`
- `calendar` -> `calendar`
- `chat` -> `matrix_space` (the space's Matrix room id)
- `tasks` -> `project` (the Tasks project id)

- It needs `twakeorg`, and rejects the event when that is not the space's organization.
- A space the copy does not have was deleted after the app provisioned it, since the app provisions on the space's created event, which reaches the queue first. The event is logged and dropped, and the app's next sync removes the resource.
- It upserts `space_resources`, so a new id replaces the old one, and sends a `spaces` live event to the space's members.
- It ignores an event for a space deleted after the event's `time`.

### Activity that becomes a card

Any other `com.twake.<app>.*` type is stored as a card for these apps:

- mail -> `messages`
- drive -> `files`
- calendar -> `events`
- meet -> `activities`
- tasks -> `activities`

Chat makes no card: its messages are already in Matrix. A chat type other than `space.provisioned` has no handler and is unrouted.

The CloudEvent fields the handler reads:

- `twakeorg`: the organization, absent for a B2C user.
- `twakeactorid`, `twakeactor`: the acting user's uuid and email.
- `data.object`: `type`, `id`, `title`, and an optional `container` (`kind`, `id`): the app's own resource the object lives in. Apps send ids, never a link.
- `data.preview`: optional text, cut to 280 characters.
- `data.state`: optional, an object the card passes to the browser as is, such as a calendar event's time. The card shows the latest event's, so an app sends the whole state on every event.
- `data.actor`: `{ type: 'token', id, name }` when an API token acted.
- `data.recipients`: who to notify (see Notifications).

The actor stored on the card is one of:

- `{ type: 'token', id, name }` from `data.actor`.
- `{ type: 'user', id, email }` from `twakeactorid`, or found by email among space members (`id` is null when no member has that email).
- `{ type: 'deleted_user' }` once the user is deleted, or for an event older than the deletion that arrives after it.
- null when the event names no actor.

The space is the one whose resource of that kind has the container's id. An app publishes a resource's provisioned event before any activity on it, and both reach the same queue in that order, so a container no space has belongs to a person: the card is for personal notifications only. A container held only by another organization's space is rejected to the dead letter queue. A user actor with a uuid who is not a member may only mean the platform event that adds them has not arrived yet, so the event is parked. An actor sent by email only that no member has is kept as is: someone outside the space, such as an attendee replying to a team calendar event. A parked event is handled after the events that came after it in the queue. The copy holds the members a linked group brings, with their resolved role, so a space with linked groups checks its actors the same way.

The card stores everything in `data` except `recipients`. An event already stored under the same `source` and `id` is skipped, and one without a `time` is stored at the time it arrives.

## The feed

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant K as RabbitMQ
  participant BE as Backend
  participant PG as Postgres
  participant FE as Browser
  K->>BE: activity event
  BE->>PG: insert activity_events
  BE->>PG: upsert feed_cards (space, object type, object id)
  BE->>K: after commit, live: feed added or changed
  K-->>BE: every replica
  BE-->>FE: event: feed (GET /stream)
  FE->>BE: GET /spaces/:spaceId/feed/items/:itemId
```

- A space's feed is its cards and its posts, newest first. The routes are in the [HTTP API](api.md#feed).
- A card exists per object: space, `object.type` and `object.id`. Its time is the object's first event, so later events change the card without moving it. It shows the latest event (by CloudEvent `time`) whatever order the events arrive in.
- An event in no space makes no card. It exists for personal notifications only.
- Posts are plain text, from editors and admins. Their authors edit and delete them. Every member reacts to cards and posts.
- Each new or changed card, post or reaction, and each deleted post, sends a `feed` live event to the space's members. Chat messages and reactions from Matrix send none.
- Nothing is posted to Matrix: the poster that sent cards to the space's Matrix room is off.

## Matrix events back into Postgres

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  S[Synapse] -->|"PUT /_matrix/app/v1/transactions/:txnId (hs_token)"| T[Transaction route]
  T -->|m.room.message| FM[(feed_messages)]
  T -->|m.reaction| FR[(feed_reactions)]
  T -->|m.room.redaction| FM & FR
  T -->|m.mentions| N[(notifications: message_mention)]
```

- Synapse authenticates with its `hs_token` (bearer or `access_token` query). The backend finds the homeserver by the token's hash.
- A transaction id already seen for that homeserver is answered `{}` without processing.
- Events are matched to a space by room id against the `matrix_space` resources of the homeserver's organizations. Events in other rooms are ignored.
- `m.room.message` is stored. An `m.replace` edit updates the original if it is in the same space, the sender matches and it is newer.
- `m.reaction` with `m.annotation` is stored with its space.
- `m.room.redaction` marks the redacted message or reaction of the same space (`redacts` at the top level or, for room v11, in the content).
- A malformed event, or one Postgres refuses to store, is skipped so Synapse does not resend the batch forever.

## Notifications

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  AE[Activity event data.recipients] --> NR[notifyRecipients]
  MM[Matrix message m.mentions] --> NU[notifyUsers]
  AS[POST /notifications/suggestions] --> NU
  NR --> NU
  NU -->|per user settings| N[(notifications)]
  N -->|live: notification| SSE[GET /stream]
```

### From activity events

Each entry in `data.recipients` is `{ uuid?, email, reason }`. The reason sets the notification type:

- `mentioned` -> `card_mention`
- `invited` -> `invitation`
- `attendee` -> `attended_event_change`
- `member` -> `space_change`

- An invalid entry is skipped with a warning; the card is still stored.
- A recipient without a `uuid` is found by email among the people the copy holds in the event's organization (space members of its spaces, and organization roles), or skipped.
- A recipient whose `uuid` the copy holds only in other organizations is skipped. A `uuid` the copy does not hold at all is notified, since the copy does not hold every member of an organization.
- Tasks events (`com.twake.tasks.*`) notify no one: Twake Tasks notifies its own users.

### From Matrix mentions

A new `m.room.message` notifies each user in `m.mentions.user_ids` who is on the same homeserver, is not the sender, and is a member of the space. The Matrix localpart is matched to the member's username (`MATRIX_LOCALPART=uid`, the default) or to the part of their email before `@` (`email`).

### From the assistant

`POST /notifications/suggestions` (a technical account's API token with `notifications:write`) creates an `assistant_suggestion` for one user, found by Matrix id as for mentions, with `{ text, pendingCallId, matrixRoomId }` as payload. It follows the user's settings and sends the `notification` live event like the others.

### Settings and delivery

- Every type is on by default except `space_change`. A row in `notification_settings` is the user's choice.
- A notification row has exactly one source: an activity event, a Matrix event or an `external_id` pushed through the API. A user gets one notification per type and source (per `external_id` for the last).
- Each inserted notification sends a `notification` live event to its user.
- The API: `GET /notifications` (paged, with the unread count and the card's type, category, actor, content and time), `POST /notifications/read`, `POST /notifications/:id/read`, `GET` and `PUT /notifications/settings`.

## Live updates

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant H as Event handler or route (transaction)
  participant K as twake-space.live exchange
  participant R as Every replica
  participant FE as Browser
  H->>H: tell(tx, event, users, data)
  Note over H: published once the transaction commits
  H->>K: live.update {event, users, data}
  Note over K: back-channel logout publishes session.revoked {sessionId}
  K-->>R: one exclusive queue per replica
  R->>FE: event: spaces / notification / feed, data: JSON
  FE->>FE: spaces: invalidate the spaces queries
```

- Handlers and routes call `tell` inside their transaction. The message is published to RabbitMQ only after the commit, so replicas only hear about committed changes, and never about a rolled back one.
- The data of each event is in the [HTTP API](api.md#get-stream): `spaces` carries `{spaceId}`, `notification` carries `{}`, and `feed` carries `{spaceId, itemId, change}`.
- Every replica consumes from its own exclusive, auto-deleted queue on the live exchange, `twake-space.live.replica.<uuid>`, bound to `live.update` and `session.revoked`, and writes the event to each open stream of the listed users. The queue lives as long as the replica's connection, so a message published while a replica is disconnected is lost; its browsers catch up when their stream reopens. A replica that is disconnected itself publishes nothing, and a failed publish is not retried.
- A revoked session goes over the same exchange, as `session.revoked`, so every replica closes that session's streams. Every minute, each replica also closes the streams of sessions revoked meanwhile, for a revocation it missed.
- `GET /stream` needs a session. It is `text/event-stream`, sends a heartbeat comment every 25 seconds, and closes when the session expires, when the session is revoked, or when the server stops. A person keeps at most 10 streams per replica, and an eleventh closes the oldest.
- The frontend reads it with `fetch` (EventSource cannot send the bearer token) and reconnects with a backoff from 1 to 30 seconds.
- On `spaces`, the frontend invalidates its spaces queries. On `notification`, it reads the assistant suggestions again. On a reconnect it invalidates every query, since events sent while the stream was closed are lost.

## The feed in the browser

- The browser reads the feed from the backend's [feed routes](api.md#feed), not from Matrix. It signs in to no homeserver, so the Feed tab works without chat.
- Each filter (all, messages, files, activities, events) is its own paged query, with no `category` for all.
- A `feed` live event updates every loaded filter of the space: an added item goes on top of the filters that show it, a changed one is replaced where it is loaded, and a removed one, or one the backend no longer finds, is dropped.
- A card's title opens the space's tab for its container: `project` -> Tasks, `drive` -> Drive, `mailbox` -> Mail, `calendar` -> Calendar, `matrix_space` -> Chat. With no container, or a tab the space does not show, the title is plain text.
- A message card opens its email: the Mail tab at `/email/<object id>`, the JMAP email id, which the frame shows below its embed route, `/embed/team-mailboxes/<id>/email/<email id>`. Mail finds the folder that holds the email and reports `/mailbox/<folder id>/email/<email id>` back. An email that is gone or not in the team mailbox leaves the frame on the Inbox.
- An event card opens its event: the Calendar tab at `/events/<object id>`, which the frame shows below its embed route, `/embed/calendars/<id>/events/<uid>`. Calendar opens the event's preview there, and reports its path back to the bare route once the preview closes.

## Retention

A purge runs at startup and every hour, under an advisory lock so one replica purges at a time:

- `activity_events`, `feed_messages`, `feed_reactions`, `feed_item_reactions`: 365 days after they were stored. A card goes with its latest event.
- `feed_posts`: 365 days after they were written. Their reactions go with them.
- `notifications`: 90 days.
- `app_service_transactions`: 7 days.

The purge does not touch the copy, `processed_events` or `last_changes`, nor the events already posted in Matrix.

## Open questions

- @rezk2ll In SaaS, which exchange carries `chat.deployment.completed`? The queue binds it on `b2b` for now (ADR 008 leaves it open).
- @rezk2ll The frontend only reads the assistant suggestions again on a `notification` live event, and has no notifications view yet. Is that planned under #90?
- @rezk2ll The `assignment` notification type exists, but nothing creates one. Which app event should?
- @rezk2ll `processed_events` and `last_changes` grow without a purge. Is that intended?
- @rezk2ll A recipient `uuid` the copy does not hold is notified, because the copy has no full list of an organization's members. Should the backend check it against the directory instead, or should apps only name people of the event's organization?
- @rezk2ll An actor outside the space (an email no member has) shows with no name. Should the card show their email, which the team calendar already shows to its members?
